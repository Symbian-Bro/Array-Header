This is a header file that can be used with your C++ programs. Pass the values such as size of the array, the array, the element user wants to find and the search function of user's choice. The array passed will get sorted automatically as there is a selection sorting algorithm within this file. Then the sorted array will be passed to the desired function.

 > -1 if the element is not found
 > -2 if the user's choice of searching mechanism is invalid
 > All other values returned are the indices of the element you are searching for
